## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of advanced SQL querying techniques to answer business-style analytical questions in a relational database environment. The queries were designed to extract meaningful insights from multiple related tables, such as identifying specific subsets of records, summarizing key metrics, and filtering results based on defined conditions.

Using multi-table joins, the queries combine data across tables to create a unified analytical view. Aggregations and GROUP BY logic are used to calculate totals, averages, and counts, while nested subqueries support more complex filtering and comparison logic. All queries were implemented and tested using Oracle SQL Developer, emphasizing clarity, correctness, and analytical reasoning.
